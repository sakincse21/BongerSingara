## 01. The Scenario
BUP is operating a smart campus using electricity purchased from the grid, rooftop solar generation, and a battery energy storage system. Campus demand, solar availability, and grid tariff vary throughout the day.

The next 24 hours of demand, solar generation, and grid tariff are already provided. In addition, campus operators may send short natural-language notes describing temporary operating conditions that affect the same 24-hour schedule.

Your service must understand the notes, convert relevant instructions into structured directives, apply those directives to the optimization problem, and return a valid low-cost operating plan.

## 02. What You Are Building
Build one HTTP API service that receives a 24-hour energy scenario plus operator notes and returns both a machine-checkable interpretation of those notes and the final 24-hour energy schedule.

• Interpret every operator note using an LLM or other language-capable generative model.
Convert relevant notes into one of the supported directive types.
Mark irrelevant notes as no_op instead of inventing an energy rule.
• Validate the interpreted directives before sending them to the optimizer.
Produce a valid schedule that satisfies the normal GridWise rules and every applicable directive.
• Minimize total grid electricity cost after correctness is satisfied.

LLM REQUIREMENT: The language model must be part of the operator-note interpretation path. Using an LLM only for plan_summary, documentation, or cosmetic text does not satisfy this requirement.

CORE IDEA: Human notes are not directly trusted as math. They are first converted to a fixed structured format, checked by guardrails, and only then applied to the optimization model.

## 04. Operator Notes & Supported Directives
Each scenario contains 1-3 operator notes. Some notes affect the current schedule; others are realistic distractors and must be ignored. Hidden cases may express the same directive using different wording.

### 4.1 Supported directive types
| Directive type | Meaning | Required structured_adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| solar_reduction | Reduce usable solar during specific hours. | "hours":[...], "factor": number} |
| minimum_battery_reserve | Keep battery energy at or above a required level. | {"hours":[...], "minimum_energy_kwh": number |
| no_charge_window | Battery charging is unavailable during specific hours. | {"hours":[...]} |
| no_discharge_window | Battery discharging is unavailable during specific hours. | {"hours:[... "]) |
| max_grid_window | Grid import may not exceed a stated amount during specific hours. | {"hours":[...], "max_grid_kwh": number} |
| no_op | The note does not affect the current 24-hour energy schedule. | null |

### 4.2 Simple examples
| Operator note | Expected interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| "Solar output will drop to about 20% from 1 PM to 3 PM." | solar_reduction; hours [13,14]; factor 0.2 |
| "Do not charge the battery between 2 PM and 4 PM." | no_charge_window; hours [14,15] |
| "Keep at least 120 kWh in reserve from 6 PM until 9 PM". | minimum_battery_reserve; hours [18,19,20]; 120 kWh |
| "The cafeteria menu changes tomorrow." | no_op |

## 05. Clauses & Optimization Task
### 5.1 Operator-note clauses
• Every operator note must produce exactly one directive_interpretation entry. Entries must be returned in note_index order: 0, 1, ... Ν-1.
• Only the directive types listed in Section 04 are accepted.
• Relevant notes must be applied to the optimization before scheduling.
Irrelevant notes must use applies = false, directive_type = no_op, and structured_adjustment = null.
The same directive may appear in different wording in hidden cases.
• Time windows use whole-hour intervals. The start hour is included and the end hour is excluded: 1 PM to 3 PM means hours [13,14].

BUP CSE Fest 2026 Hackathon Preliminary Problem Statement

• The LLM must not invent demand, solar, tariff, battery limits, or unsupported directive types.
A schedule that interprets a note correctly but does not apply it is still incorrect.
• For every non-no_op directive, applies must be true. no_op is the only directive allowed with applies = false.
• Every hours array inside structured_adjustment must contain unique integers from 0 through 23 in ascending order.
• For solar_reduction, factor means the usable fraction that remains. Example: an 80% reduction means factor $=0.2$
• Organizer valid scoring scenarios are feasible and will not require mutually contradictory hard directives to be satisfied at the same time.

### 5.2 Optimization objective
After applying all valid directive adjustments, minimize the total cost of grid electricity over the 24-hour horizon:

$$\text{total\_cost\_bdt} = \text{SUM}(\text{grid\_kwh}[h] \cdot \text{tariff\_bdt\_per\_kwh}[h]) \text{ for } h=0..23$$

Lower cost is better, but a low-cost schedule is invalid if it breaks any energy, battery, or operator-directive rule.

### 5.3 How directives change the math
| Directive | Deterministic effect used by the optimizer |
| --- | --- |
| solar_reduction | effective_solar[h] = original_solar[h] * factor for each listed hour. |
| minimum_battery_reserve | battery_energy_after_kwh[h] >= max(base minimum_energy_kwh, directive minimum_energy_kwh) for each listed hour. |
| no_charge_window | battery charge amount $=0$ in the listed hours. |
| no_discharge_window | battery discharge amount $=0$ in the listed hours. |
| max_grid_window | grid_kwh[h] <= max_grid_kwh in the listed hours. |
| no_op | No change to the optimization model. |

## 06. API Contract
The judge harness exercises only the endpoints below. Endpoint names must match exactly.
| Endpoint | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| GET/health | Return HTTP 200 with a JSON object containing status = "ok" when the service is ready. |
| POST/optimize-energy | Accept one scenario JSON object and return one interpretation + optimization-plan JSON object. |

### 6.1 HTTP response codes
| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | Successful health response or successful optimization response. |
| 400 | Malformed JSON or structurally invalid request. |
| 422 | Optional: semantically invalid but well-formed request. |
| 500 | Controlled internal error. Do not expose secrets or raw stack traces. |

### 6.2 Health response
```json
{
"status": "ok"
}
```

## 07. Request Schema
POST/optimize-energy accepts one JSON object. The hours array must contain exactly 24 entries for hours 0 through 23. operator_notes must contain 1-3 non-empty natural-language strings, each referring to the same 24-hour scenario.

### 7.1 Top-level fields
| Field | Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scenario_id | string | Unique synthetic scenario identifier. |
| operator_notes | array[1..3] of string | Natural-language campus operator notes to interpret. |
| hours | array[24] | Hourly demand, solar availability, and grid tariff. |
| battery | object | Battery capacity, starting energy, reserve, and hourly limits. |

### 7.2 Hour entry
| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hour | integer | Unique integer from 0 to 23. |
| demand_kwh | number | Campus demand that must be supplied in this hour. |
| solar_kwh | number | Base solar energy available before operator-note adjustments. |
| tariff_bdt_per_kwh | number | Grid electricity price for this hour. |

### 7.3 Battery object

| --- | --- |
| capacity_kwh | Maximum energy the battery can store. |
| initial_energy_kwh | Battery energy at the start of hour 0. |
| minimum_energy_kwh | Base reserve level the battery must never go below. |
| max_charge_kwh_per_hour | Maximum energy that may be added in one hour. |
| max_discharge_kwh_per_hour | Maximum energy that may be removed in one hour. |

### 7.4 Example request shape
```json
{
"scenario_id": "GRID-101",
"operator_notes": [
"Solar output will drop to about 20% from 1 PM to 3 PM.",
"Do not charge the battery between 2 PM and 4 PM.",
"The cafeteria menu changes tomorrow."
1.
"hours": [
1.
{"hour": 0, "demand_kwh": 180, "solar_kwh": 0, "tariff_bdt_per_kwh": 7 ,
22 more hourly entries....
{"hour": 23, "demand_kwh": 200, "solar_kwh": 0, "tariff_bdt_per_kwh":9}
"battery": {
}
"capacity_kwh": 500,
"initial_energy_kwh": 200,
"minimum_energy_kwh": 50,
"max_charge_kwh_per_hour": 100,
"max_discharge_kwh_per_hour": 100
```

## 08. LLM Interpretation Guardrails
LLM output must be treated as untrusted structured data until deterministic validation passes.
| Guardrail | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Allowed types | directive_type must be one of the values in Section 04. |

Dept. of CSE, BUP 5 fest.bupcopc.tech

---

BUP CSE Fest 2026 Hackathon Preliminary Problem Statement

| Guardrail | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Note mapping | note_index must identify an existing operator note and each note must appear once. |
| Hours | Every listed hour must be a unique integer from 0 through 23, returned in ascending order. |
| Solar factor | For solar_reduction, factor must be between 0 and 1 inclusive. |
| Battery reserve | Reserve values must be finite, non-negative, and not exceed battery capacity. |
| Grid cap | max_grid_kwh must be finite and non-negative. |
| No invention | The interpretation may not change base demand, tariff, or battery parameters unless a supported directive explicitly allows it. |
| Final replay | The completed schedule is replayed after optimization to verify every extracted directive was actually followed. |
| applies semantics | For no_op: applies = false and structured_adjustment = null. For every other directive: applies = true and structured_adjustment must match the required shape in Section 04. |
| Feasible judge scenarios | Valid organizer scoring scenarios will have a feasible ground-truth interpretation and will not require contradictory hard directives. |

SAFE FAILURE: If the LLM returns malformed or unsupported structured output, the service must handle it in a controlled way. The service must not silently invent a new directive type or crash.

## 09. Battery & Energy Rules
The existing GridWise energy rules remain unchanged. The judge independently replays the final schedule hour by hour using the effective solar and any additional operator directives.

### 9.1 Battery state
charge: $E_{\text{after}} = E_{\text{before}} + \text{battery\_kwh}$  
discharge: $E_{\text{after}} = E_{\text{before}} - \text{battery\_kwh}$  
idle: $E_{\text{after}} = E_{\text{before}}$ and $\text{battery\_kwh} = 0$

### 9.2 Battery bounds
$$\text{minimum\_energy\_kwh} \le E_{\text{after}} \le \text{capacity\_kwh}$$
If a minimum_battery_reserve directive is active, its reserve may be higher than the base minimum for those hours.

### 9.3 Hourly charge/discharge limits
if action = charge: $\text{battery\_kwh} \le \text{max\_charge\_kwh\_per\_hour}$  
if action = discharge: $\text{battery\_kwh} \le \text{max\_discharge\_kwh\_per\_hour}$

### 9.4 Solar usage
$$0 \le \text{solar\_used\_kwh} \le \text{effective\_solar\_kwh} \text{ for that hour}$$
Unused solar is curtailed. Grid export is not part of this challenge.

### 9.5 Energy balance
$$\text{grid\_kwh} + \text{solar\_used\_kwh} + \text{battery\_discharge\_kwh} = \text{demand\_kwh} + \text{battery\_charge\_kwh}$$

### 9.6 End-of-day battery neutrality
final $\text{battery\_energy\_after\_kwh} = \text{initial\_energy\_kwh}$

WHY THIS RULE EXISTS: The starting battery may shift energy between hours, but it cannot be consumed as a free one-time source by ending the day at a lower state of charge.

## 10. Response Schema
A successful POST /optimize-energy response must include both the operator-note interpretation and the final 24-hour schedule.

### 10.1 Top-level response fields
| Field | Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scenario id | string | Must match the request scenario_id. |
| directive_interpretation | array | One machine-checkable interpretation entry for every operator note. |
| hourly_plan | array[24] | One plan entry for every hour 0 through 23. |
| total_grid_kwh | number | Sum of grid_kwh across all 24 hours. |
| total cost bdt | number | Calculated total grid electricity cost. |
| peak_grid_kwh | number | Maximum hourly grid_kwh in the returned plan. |
| plan_summary | string | Short human-readable explanation of the final strategy. |

### 10.2 Directive interpretation entry
| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| note index | Zero-based index of the corresponding operator_notes entry. |
| applies | true for every applicable non-no_op directive; false only for no_op. |

### 10.4 Example interpretation fragment
| "directive_interpretation": [  {  "note_index": 0,  "applies": true,  "directive_type": "solar_reduction",  "structured_adjustment":  "hours": [13, 14], "factor": 0.2),  "explanation": "Solar availability is reduced during panel cleaning." |
| --- |
| }, |
| {  "note_index": 2,  "applies": false,  "directive_type": "no_op",  "structured_adjustment": null,  "explanation": "This note does not affect today's energy schedule." |
| } |
| 1 |

## 11. Exact Validation & Hidden Evaluation
Hidden evaluation checks both language understanding and energy optimization. Teams should not assume that only total_cost_bdt or the free-text explanation is checked.

### 11.1 Interpretation checks
Correctly identify whether each note applies or is no_op.
• Return the correct directive type.
Extract the correct hours and numeric values within the allowed tolerance.
Remain robust when the same directive is paraphrased in different ways.
• Return one entry per note in note_index order, with no missing or duplicate mappings.
• Match the required structured_adjustment shape for the selected directive type.
• Use applies = false only for $no\_op$ all applicable directives use applies = true.

### 11.2 Downstream application checks
• The judge recomputes effective solar after solar_reduction directives.
The judge verifies reserve, no-charge, no-discharge, and grid-cap directives directly against hourly_plan.
• Correct extraction without correct downstream application does not pass the case.

### 11.3 Existing GridWise consistency checks
hourly_plan contains exactly 24 unique hours, 0 through 23.
• Required numeric values are finite and non-negative.
Battery transitions, capacity, minimum energy, and hourly rate limits are valid.
• Solar usage never exceeds effective available solar.
The energy-balance equation holds every hour.
• Final battery energy equals initial battery energy.
 total_grid_kwh, total_cost_bdt, and peak_grid_kwh match values recalculated from hourly_plan.

BUP CSE Fest 2026 Hackathon Preliminary Problem Statement

### 11.4 Hidden language variation
The same underlying rule may be written differently in hidden cases. For example, all three notes below mean the same solar-reduction directive:

Hidden scoring notes will map to exactly one supported directive type or no_op. They may be paraphrased, but they will not require an unpublished directive type or an impossible combination of hard constraints.

#### Example wording
"PV production will drop to about 20% between 13:00 and 15:00."
"Panel washing from one until three will leave roughly one-fifth of normal solar output."
"Expect an 80% reduction in rooftop solar during the 1-3 PM maintenance window."

NO BYTE-FOR-BYTE MATCHING: Equivalent valid optimal schedules may differ. The judge evaluates structured interpretation, directive application, schedule validity, and recalculated cost rather than exact JSON equality with one reference plan.

### 11.5 Numeric tolerance
For normal floating-point arithmetic, judge calculations should treat values within an absolute tolerance of 0.01 kWh or 0.01 BDT as equivalent unless the official judge package specifies a stricter value.

## 12. Canonical Specification Note
For this challenge, this Problem Statement is the canonical source for endpoint names, request/response fields, operator-note directive types, interpretation guardrails, battery behavior, energy accounting, and optimization validity rules.

The separate Participant Guide & Evaluation Rubric remains canonical for deployment, repository policy, submission procedure, performance requirements, evaluation weights, penalties, and tie-breakers.

FINAL REMINDER: Understand the operator notes first. Validate the extracted directives. Apply them to the optimization. Then produce a valid 24-hour schedule and minimize cost.
